# 📚 Project Memory - AI History Prompts

This folder contains detailed logs of all major implementations and decisions made during the development of this project. 

## Purpose

The **Project Memory** system ensures:
- ✅ Context preservation across AI sessions
- ✅ Prevention of conflicting decisions
- ✅ Easy reference for future modifications
- ✅ Documentation of technical approaches and design choices

## Usage

Before making changes to any feature, read the relevant log file:
```
"Read the history in XXX-feature-name.md before making changes"
```

## Naming Convention

Files are named: `XXX-feature-name.md`
- `XXX` = Sequential number (001, 002, 003...)
- `feature-name` = Descriptive name (e.g., hero-slider, ci-cd-pipeline)

## Log Template

Each log file follows this structure:

```markdown
## User Request
(Summary of what was asked for)

## Specification
(Technical approach, libraries used, design choices)

## Prompt Used
(The actual prompt that triggered this implementation)

## Implementation Details
(List of files created/modified with code logic explanation)

## Future Considerations
(Notes for future modifications)
```
